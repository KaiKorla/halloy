# Base16

The [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color scheme framework
includes hundreds of color schemes build using 16 colors. These color schemes have
are compiled for Halloy in the
[`4e554c4c/base16-halloy`](https://github.com/4e554c4c/base16-halloy)
repository.

To use these themes, download `themes.tar.gz` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/4e554c4c/base16-halloy/releases/latest)
and unpack it to the `themes` folder in the Halloy configuration directory. Then
you can enable themes individually in `config.toml`.

**Example**

```toml
# Static
theme = "base16-gruvbox-dark-hard"
```
