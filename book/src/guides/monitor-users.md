# Monitor users

Halloy has [monitor](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/monitor) support if the server has the IRCv3 Monitor extension.

> ðŸ’¡ A protocol for notification of when clients become online/offline

To use the feature you need to add the user(s) you wish to monitor. This can be done in two ways:

* You can add a list of user directly to the configuration file. [See configuration option.](../configuration/servers.md#monitor)
* You can add users through `/monitor` directly in Halloy. 

Examples with the `/monitor` command:

```toml
/monitor + casperstorm # Add user to list being monitored
/monitor - casperstorm # Remove user from list being monitored
/monitor c # Clear the list of users being monitored
/monitor l # Get list of users being monitored
/monitor s # For each user in the list being monitored, get their current status
```
